# Description

This is a sentiment analysis project on Reddit data, specifically on the subreddits 'stopsmoking' and 'stopdrinking'. Three .py files currently in the
repository. 'addictionStudy.py' and 'addictionStudy_2.py' files contain codes on extracting n-grams from the text data. 'addictionStudy_3.py' contains
code on building an RNN-LSTM model with four layers. (Files will be edited and more files will be added to the repository).
